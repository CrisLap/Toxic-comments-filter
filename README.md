# Deep Learning Project: Toxic Comment Filter

Hello and welcome! Thank you for taking the time to explore this project :blush:

The present project aims to develop a Deep Learning multi-label classification model for filtering toxic comments within social network platforms.

To achieve this goal, the project is divided into several distinct steps:

* **Data Exploration**: In this phase, we will delve into the dataset to gain a better understanding of the data;
* **Data Pre-processing**: The collected dataset will undergo a comprehensive data cleaning and pre-processing pipeline. This includes tasks such as text tokenization to transform the raw data into a format suitable for training Deep Learning models;
* **Model Building and Evaluation**: The next step is to train different Deep Learning models on the preprocessed text data, capable of multi-label classification.
